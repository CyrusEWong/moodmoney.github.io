<h1> Background and Creation </h1>
  <p> This project was brainstormed and the notion was developed at the first Financial Planning Academy at Cal State Fullerton. 
    This is an expansion of said idea.</p>
  <h2> Mood Money </h2>
<p>Most budgeting apps fail because they treat money as pure math. Ignoring the emotional side of 
  spending. People don’t overspend because they’re bad at numbers, they do it because of stress, boredom, or 
  social pressure. Traditional apps shame users with red alerts and rigid categories, which only fuels guilt 
  and abandonment. Worse, they assume everyone has predictable incomes and willpower, leaving freelancers, 
  ADHDers, and emotional spenders behind. </p>

<p> Mood Money bridges behavioral finance and tech by adapting to your psychology in real time. It tracks not just what you spend, but how you feel when 
  spending, using AI to detect patterns (e.g., "You spend 42% more when anxious"). After every purchase a pop-up will appear, asking how you feel before 
  and after the purchase.
